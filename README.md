**ToDo** is a simple application to keep track of stuff you have to do (a to-do list, basically), developed with Unity3D.

# How to use:

**1)** Once you get the application up and running, if it is the first time you are using it, you will probably face a black background with a tiny menu at the top;

**2)** In the menu you will have 3 buttons:
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="/Assets/Resources/Textures/TopMenu/Buttons/UndoEnabled.png?raw=true" width="16" height="16" alt="ToDo Icon" style="vertical-allign:middle;"/></img> Used to undo a task deletion;</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="/Assets/Resources/Textures/TopMenu/Buttons/Add.png?raw=true" width="16" height="16" alt="ToDo Icon" style="vertical-allign:middle;"/></img> Used to add a new group of tasks (or a single one);</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="/Assets/Resources/Textures/TopMenu/Buttons/Options.png?raw=true" width="16" height="16" alt="ToDo Icon" style="vertical-allign:middle;"/></img> Used to access app settings (currently unavailable);</p>

**3)** After pressing "<img src="/Assets/Resources/Textures/TopMenu/Buttons/Add.png?raw=true" width="16" height="16" alt="ToDo Icon" style="vertical-allign:middle;"/></img>" you are prompted with a text area where you are supposed to type in the tasks you want to add, one per line. Once you are ready, press "Add" to fill your list.

	<img src="/Screenshots/NewTaskAdded.png" width="360" height="640" alt="New tasks added">
</p>

As you can see in the images above, the tasks are added in the order you typed them in and with random colors;

**4)** Once you have completed one of them, just click on the square at the right of the correspondant task and it will be deleted from your list;
